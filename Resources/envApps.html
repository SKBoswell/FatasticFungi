            <p>Did you know that mushrooms have the ability to break down toxic things in our environment like dirty oil, plastic, and chemicals? This process is called <span>mycoremediation.</span> </p>
            <p>Fungi is one of the earliest organisms to occupy land on this planet and it is the <span>largest</span> organism on this planet occupying over 2,384 acres of soil in Oregon’s Blue Mountains. They have been evolving and developing powerful adaptations over 1,430 million years and are one of the <span>most resilient</span> organisms on this planet. Not only can they eat oil, but spores of mushrooms have survived in sea vents deep in the Earth below the ocean only to be discovered 60 million years later and germinated to produce mushroom fruiting bodies! </p>
            <p> <span>It is about time that humans began recognizing the power of fungi and mycoremediation.</span> </p>

            <h2 class="text-center text-secondary py-3">Here's the reality..</h2>
            <p>If Earth’s history is compared to a calendar year, modern human life has existed for <span>23</span> minutes and we have used <span>one third</span> of Earth’s natural resources in the last <span>.2</span> seconds… as a result of using these resources more than 400 millions tons of hazardous waste is produced every year, and 99% of the stuff we buy is trashed within 6 months.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately traditional industrial methods of recycling this waste and cleaning/remediating this waste <span>isn’t up to speed with the rapid rate in which humans are creating this toxic waste.</span> Traditional methods being used today are missing the connection of using the most resilient natural organisms on this planet that have been evolving for thousands of millions years to decompose the most complex molecules and organic matter on planet Earth. With all the pollution, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, etc… <span>It’s time to ally with fungi and use mycoremediation to make a difference in our world!</span> </p>

            <h3>The types of pollutants mycoremediation can help with</h3>
            <p>Yes, mycoremediation can help against pollution. There are three main types of physical pollutants that fungi can help clean up from our Earth using mycoremediation: <span> microbes, heavy metals, and chemicals.</span> </p>
            <p>Mycelia/mycelium (the “roots” of fungi) have antimicrobial properties and form a thick dense web like filter that can be easily employed in water systems (generally ones where fecal matter washes into the waterways) to <span>trap, neutralize, and/or kill any pathogenic microbes that may be present in the water. </span> </p>
            <p>Heavy metals cannot be broken down but they can be sequestered into or around the fungi in order to render them immobile or prevent further reading. </p>
            <p>Fungi presses very powerful extracellular lignolytic oxidative enzymes, which are able to <span>break down</span> very complex anthropogenic toxic chemicals completely into simple hydrogen, carbon and oxygen molecules, or cleave the complex molecules into smaller ones so other microbes can come in and further break them down. The way fungi break down complex chemicals can be seen on the forest floor with decomposing trees and logs. By looking at the different states of decay, the ways different fungi excrete various enzymes to break down specific parts of molecules is clear.</p>

            <h3>How to go further with mycoremediation</h3>
            <p>Mycoremediation is a powerful opportunity for us to heal the Earth from the pollution humans have inflicted on it. Fungi have been proven successful in remediating damage from bacteria, heavy metals, and chemical pollutants in our environment. <span>Mycoremediation can be used and learned by anyone and successfully applied by anyone in their own backyard or on a larger commercial scale.</span> Its accessibility, lack of cost, and scalability means it is one of the most promising tools we have to fight and tackle pollution on our Earth. We can even use mushrooms for mycoremediation throughout our own bodies.</span> </p>
            <p>It’s the root-mycelia that does all the work. Mycelia consume their food externally, by secreting powerful enzymes that break down molecules. In other words, they <span>“digest” whatever substrate, or surface, they’re growing on, converting it to nutrients and—depending on the substrate—edible mushrooms.</span> </p>
            <p>Proponents say it’s a natural, more benign, and potentially cheaper alternative to the “scrape and burn” approach to environmental clean-up, which involves digging up contaminated soil and incinerating it.</p>

        <div class="env-app-text w-75">
            <h3>So why isn't mycoremediation a more common practice?</h3> 
            <p>One reason is that federal regulations require the removal of 100 percent of targeted contaminants within a short time frame. Current mycoremediation solutions simply work too slowly to be embraced on an industrial scale. In nature, mushrooms break down all kinds of substances, and we’re just beginning to look at this more closely in the lab and in field studies. But we don’t yet know the speed of the breakdown, and how effective that breakdown is.</p>    
            <p>Like other subfields of bioremediation, mycoremediaiton has failed to attract much investment. This is an inherent problem in the bioremediation industry. We are not producing a product that people want to buy. We are producing something that companies are sometimes forced to do. It’s hard to make a great business case for it. Or, quite frankly, a case for academic research.</p>
            <p>Funding is hard to come by. It's much easier to find funding for other types of research. That means it falls on citizen scientists and garage researchers to do the work.</p>
